      "I’ve worked hard to find my place in this world and have been rewarded with a rich and fulfilling life. I was born near the southern tip of India; when I reached age 12, my parents moved us to America so that I could get an education. We settled in Florida where I went to high school, college, and medical school. My wife and I had two children—a son and a daughter—and we’ve been very happily married for more than 40 years.\n",

      "I started my own family practice in the small community of Gainesville, Florida. I really enjoyed practicing medicine and helping people get back on their feet again after getting sick or injured. At the time, though, I felt that I could do more for people if I knew their complete medical history—which is why I decided to go into internal medicine.\n",
      "I’ve been happily practicing in Jacksonville since 1986. One of my favorite things about internal medicine is that it allows me to help a lot of patients at one time, rather than just focusing on one individual patient.\n",
      "A very important part of helping people is educating them and working with them to prevent illness or injury from occurring in the first place. That’s why I became certified in hypertension management and now provide my patients with personalized education about how they can keep their blood pressure under control.\n",
      "As a teacher, I enjoy lecturing to medical students at Mayo Clinic and other institutions of higher learning. I also feel privileged to be able to give back by serving as the director of internal medicine for the University of Florida College of Medicine Jacksonville.\n",
      "I’m passionate about my family; we have a very close-knit group. We are all healthy, so we consider ourselves to be very lucky! I also have a great love for golf and other sports like tennis. My wife is a retired nurse who enjoys sewing and gardening.\n",

      "That is a very good point, and a big part of the reason why I posted this. There are lots of things which most people would agree with (being honest, etc.) but they still don’t know what to do about them in their lives.\n",

      "But recently, I’ve discovered this quote by Jim Carrey (of all people): “Become addicted to continuous learning. Reading is the essential thing” and since then I have read more than I ever could in my life! This is something that has really changed me and I am excited about it every single day!\n",

      "The year was 2005 and I had just started my first job as a trainee with an investment bank based in Mumbai. The days were long; the pressure was high, and so was the pay! Every day before leaving home, I made it a point to look into the mirror and give myself a pep talk: “I’m the best there is. I can do this.” And every night, my husband, who works in the same field, would share his experiences with me. He said that he had seen some very bright and talented people lose their confidence during training as they were constantly compared to those ahead of them. They were told time and again how far behind they were. Some even went so low mentally that they ended up quitting the job in a few months! So, I was determined not to let that happen to me.\n",
      "The first two days were the worst as I felt like I didn’t have what it took to excel at this level. But then again, I was told by my senior colleagues, “You will be fine once you start working on the deals.” So, I put all my efforts into learning and completing the tasks assigned to me and soon enough, there came a time when I started feeling good about what I had done in a day. And then it happened – two weeks after I had joined work; I was given the responsibility of leading a research assignment for our CEO! And that was just the beginning…\n",
      "I never thought I would become so confident that I could even teach someone else how to excel, but my experiences have taught me that it can be done. All you need is the desire and willingness to learn and improve. So here are some of the things I learnt from my journey:\n",
      "1) Don’t let anyone dictate your dreams or aspirations – Ever! You are a unique human being with unique potential. Let no one tell you what is in store for you, because they can never know what’s inside your heart and soul. And if they try to do that – run away from them as fast as you can!\n",
      "2) Believe in yourself – No matter how talented or gifted someone else might be; they have no power over your abilities unless you allow it. It is not about whether you are the most\n",

      "Giving, in my book, means using your gifts and talents for something larger than yourself. It may involve taking a risk or moving out of your comfort zone; it definitely requires discipline and focus. But once you find that place where your passion meets the world's need, something amazing happens: You stop being obsessed with yourself!\n",
      "This is a lesson I have been learning my whole life—and one I am still trying to master. I was raised in a family of givers. My father, who died when I was 15, had a heart as big as the world and believed that if you live right and do right by others, everything will work itself out.\n",
      "My mother is a great role model for generosity. She has always found ways to give back: to her family, to her church and community, to the poor. I have been blessed with a lot of good things in life, but none of them can compare with the greatest wealth of all—which is the act of giving itself.\n",
      "When I was growing up, we never had much money. Mom worked hard to support us as a hospital dietitian and sometimes took on extra work as a private chef. Dad was a psychiatrist in the Air Force; later he started his own practice. One of my most vivid childhood memories is of watching my dad make house calls to patients who couldn't afford his regular rates. He didn't do it for money, but because he thought it was the right thing to do.\n",
      "The first time I gave a speech in public—at a school assembly when I was 14 years old—I talked about my dad and how he had inspired me. The title of my talk was \"To Live Is to Give.\" It wasn't original; Dad always used to say that. But as I spoke those words into the microphone, I realized they were true.\n",
      "Living is giving. If you aren't giving, you aren't living. Giving means being generous with your time and energy, your love and compassion—and yes, your money. It means thinking about how you can help others, not just yourself. It means taking responsibility for the people around you,\n",

After graduating from Webster University with an undergraduate degree in Psychology, I traveled to Israel for a few months and then moved back to the US to attend graduate school at California Coast University.\n",
      "During my time in grad school I worked as a counselor for at-risk children. It was then that I realized that what I really wanted to do is help people heal through the power of love, kindness and compassion. This led me into the field of holistic healthcare where I have spent the last 10 years helping people heal their bodies and minds from physical illnesses like cancer or diabetes all the way up to emotional issues such as addiction or depression.\n",
      "Although my life has been full of challenging moments, it’s also filled with amazing experiences that have helped shaped who I am today. These include traveling to 25 countries around the world, living in a Buddhist monastery for almost a year and serving as an ambassador for peace in Israel.\n",
      "As a result, I developed a love of people from many different cultures and backgrounds. I believe that we can all learn something from each other if we just take the time to listen.\n",
      "I am also passionate about helping people create healthy relationships with food through my work as an accredited holistic nutritionist in California. It’s a privilege to help others heal their bodies and minds so they can live a life filled with purpose, meaning and love.\n",
