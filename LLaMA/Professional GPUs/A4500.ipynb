      "My favorite quote is by Maya Angelou, “People will forget what you said; people will forget what you did; but people will never forget how you made them feel.” This is my mantra when it comes to my artwork – the way I want my audience to feel. When I’m creating, I hope that my work makes others smile and lifts their spirits.\n",
      "I have always been fascinated with the idea of making art accessible to anyone and everyone. Art should be seen as a lifestyle, not simply an industry or hobby, because it has the ability to transform someone’s day. I want people to feel inspired by my work, because I believe when you are feeling inspired your creativity flows naturally and your confidence blooms.\n",
      "My artwork is a reflection of my personal style and vision which is a fusion of modern, minimalism mixed with classic elegance. My designs range from modern abstract paintings to hand-drawn illustrations that have been digitally edited. I am also an avid photographer so you will often see me utilizing photography in my work as well.\n",
      "The first time I ever picked up a paintbrush, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. The colors spoke to me and I was overwhelmed with emotions. I never stopped painting after that moment, and for me painting is truly a form of meditation. It’s when I feel my most calm and centered.\n",
      "When you purchase one of my art pieces – whether it be an original or print – I want you to connect to the piece in such a way that it inspires your personal creativity. Maybe you’ll be inspired to paint, draw, design clothing or make something from scratch. Or maybe you’ll simply be inspired to go out and explore with a positive attitude.\n",
      "I hope my work makes you feel good about yourself – whether that means treating yourself to coffee in the morning, wearing your favorite pair of jeans or getting a new haircut.\n",
      "When I am not busy painting or photographing, you can find me reading a book, playing volleyball or spending time with my family and friends. I love all kinds of music and am a big fan of the arts.\n",
      "I have always been a sucker for a good story so please feel free to drop me a line if you want to learn more about my art\n",

This feeling of happiness and fulfillment doesn’t need to happen immediately after you decide on a path. It might take some time, but if you keep going in the direction you have chosen, you will eventually find your true purpose!\n",

Either way is perfectly normal, as long as you don’t give up on finding out for yourself. If you keep trying different things until something clicks, your true purpose will eventually reveal itself!\n",

One day, I asked her why she never shared her paintings with anyone else. Why wasn’t she selling them? She told me that she wanted to do things right first and that she didn’t feel she had created anything good enough yet.\n",

      "My name is Tessa and my story starts at a very young age when I was diagnosed with cancer. When I was 15 months old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had been acting strange, not moving as much as she knew I should be. She thought maybe it was just due to my being teething, but the doctor told us that he didn’t think I would make it through the night.\n",
      "I was diagnosed with neuroblastoma and was in remission for a few years until the cancer came back when I was 8. Because of my age, there wasn’t as much they could do, so we began chemotherapy treatments. It was tough going to school during treatment because I didn’t have any energy. My mom said that every time she would drop me off at school, she would cry and just hope I made it through the day.\n",
      "But I did make it through those days and after a few rounds of chemotherapy treatments my doctors told us they were going to try a bone marrow transplant. There was only one match in Europe because none here in the U.S. fit me so that’s where we had to go for treatment. We flew there for 5 weeks and then returned back home to continue treatment with chemotherapy.\n",
      "My mom would always tell us how lucky we were because they have children die every day of cancer, but we never thought about it like that. We just knew we were the lucky ones because we got a second chance at life. I was in remission for 8 years and then one day my mom said she felt something different when she touched me. She couldn’t explain how she knew or what it meant, but her gut told us to get another opinion on why the cancer came back. The doctors did more tests and found a spot in my spine that they weren’t able to remove with chemotherapy so we chose to go through radiation treatments as opposed to surgery because surgery would have left me paralyzed for life.\n",
      "Once I finished treatment, my doctor told us that the cancer had spread from my bone marrow to my brain and that I only had 3 months to live. We were\n",
